"""
ABF files contain data which is arranged on disk as one long continuous
recording. Scientists often divide-up records into sweeps even though the
data itself is not divided into sweeps.

To aid in working with sweeps, helper functions were created which take-in
ABF objects and populate them with useful objects to make working with sweeps
simpler. All sweep-related code lies here and is imported into the ABF class.
