# ABF Analysis Software
Analysis of data from electrophysiological experiments (e.g., action potential detection) should be performed
in a layer of abstraction above the code that lives in [/src](/src) (which is purely deticated to _reading_
the content of ABF files).

***Presentation-ready analysis code has not yet been written***
