**NOTES ABOUT EXAMPLE CODE:** This folder contains a standalone collection of code created from a snapshot of a work-in-progress project. It is meant for educational purposes only, and better code which does the same things may be found elsewhere
in this project.

## Notable Changes
* added code to compare headers of two ABF files. This was actually really useful. I.e., quickly find the keys that change between single-channel or dual-channel recordings, or VC vs IC recordings.
* stuck in a matplotlib demo
* using the warnings module to warn about numpy not being installed
* add loadtime message (and ability to silence it)
* got a good start for the ABF class. I haven't locked anything in yet.
