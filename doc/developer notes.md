## Python script line length (I use 110)
Some developers are pushing for a 120 character line length, but PEP8 still restructes to under 80.
I prefer longer lines because python can sometimes get highly nested (so there's lots of white space) 
and it's easier to read if each thought occurs on a single line. However I notice GitHub code blocks 
with very long lines get cut off. I found that a line length of 110 is long enough for me, and looks good 
on GitHub.
