# Standalone ABF Header Reader

The best most up-to-date, single-file, dependency-free ABF header reader is the one containing the ABFheader class at the core of the pyabf package: [/src/pyabf/header.py](/src/pyabf/header.py)

Code in folders here represents standalone scripts early in development and documentation of my thought process behind why I designed-in the features that I did. They're kept here for historical value only.
