# pyABF Documentation
pyABF was written to be so intuitive to use (with a predictive IDE) that extensive documentation is not necessary.
The best way to learn how to interact with pyABF is to check out the [examples](getting-started), then just start using it!

## Getting Started
* [Getting Started with pyABF](getting-started) - reading ABFs and plotting sweeps with matplotlib

## Advanced Topics
* [Unofficial ABF File Format Guide](advanced/abf-file-format) - details the file structure of ABF files
* [Creating Arbitrary Stimulus Waveforms](advanced/creating-waveforms/) - creating custom stimulus waveforms from scratch with Python
* [Gaussian Filtering with Numpy](advanced/python/gaussian-filter-with-numpy.ipynb)
* [Demo data plotted with common colormaps](advanced/v1%20cookbook/2017-11-12%20colormaps/colormaps.pdf)
* [Membrane Test Theory and Analaysis Techniques](advanced/v1%20cookbook/memtest-simulation.ipynb) - including how to measure cell capacitance from voltage-clamp steps
* [pyABF V1 cookbook](advanced/cookbook) - the syntax is outdated, but some code and theory is useful

## Having Problems?
If you are encountering a problem, unexpected behavior, or have a use case I haven't anticipated, let me know about it!
You can ***e-mail me (SWHarden@gmail.com) and attach the ABF you are having trouble with*** so I can modify the code to 
ensure your ABF format is supported! I can only develop for (and test with) ABFs I have access to, so I appreciate your
contributions!

## Publishing Something Cool?
I'm glad the pyABF project facilitated your research!
Consider citing this project by name so it can benefit others too:

> _"Computational analysis of electrophysiological recordings was performed using custom
> software written for Python 3.6 and the pyABF module."_

If your publication was supported by pyABF, let me know about it! I'd love to list it here.
